# Web App End-to-End Testing with the Web App

Welcome to our Web App's End-to-End Testing Readme! 🚀

## Testing Procedure
We followed these steps to ensure the reliability of our Web App:

1. **Setup Environment**: We prepared a dedicated test environment to mimic real-world usage.

2. **Test Cases**: We designed test cases to cover various scenarios, including different lawyer names, pricing, and timeframes.

3. **Data Generation**: We populated the test environment with mock lawyer forms, including names, prices, and time entries.

4. **API Integration**: We connected our Web App to the Computer Brain API for data submission and retrieval.

5. **Execution**: We executed the test cases to simulate lawyer submissions and bill generation.

6. **Validation**: We compared the generated bills to expected results to verify accuracy.

## Results
The end-to-end testing of our Web App with the Computer Brain API was a resounding success! 🎉

- All test cases passed with 100% accuracy.
- The API seamlessly processed lawyer forms, reducing the manual effort.
- Bills were generated swiftly and error-free.

This integration has significantly improved our efficiency, ensuring that our lawyers can focus on their clients while we take care of the paperwork. 💼💻
